# Universae Landing Page

## Background
This landing page was created for the purpose of being a landing page for an email campaign for reaching out to Universae students to get them to come to Utah Tech. It initally started focused around the masters programs, but  was shifted to be for undergrad, so if you notice some weird changes in the commit history, that's why. 

## Building Process
First off, I apoligize if you need to change this and it's a mess. This was my first time with React and Tailwind, as well as my first time being given a design and having to style based off of it. You can find the style reference [here](UniversaeLandingPageDesignWithCopy.ai). This was all built in Replit (also my first time) so there are some unnecesarry parts that it added in the beginning. I got the baseline from the Replit agent mode which got me like 50% and I did almost everything from there on. If this is being worked on later, don't be afraid to reach out to me with any questions.
